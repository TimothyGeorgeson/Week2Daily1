Intents, Seekbars, and ListView

Assignment Instructions:
Create an application to have the following features
1. Use implicit intents
	a) to take a picture from the phone and show it in the ImageView.
	b) share string with other apps (Mail, Sms etc)
	c) to call a number directly from the app (by parsing Phone number)	
2. Have a EMI calculator which updates the textview with an integer value which can be
 updated using a “seekbar” as we move it left and right.  And calculate the EMI.
3. have a user form to add person object on each button click and then pass
 the list of persons to the another activity to view all persons in a ListView.
 (You can use the toString() for each item in the listView)
